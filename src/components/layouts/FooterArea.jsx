                <p>CZODIAC is a community of innovators, creators, coders, and artists building experiments with new

                   content to this community. While our members always do our best to abide 
                   by the Terms of Use set out below, its important that you understand that
                   there's no central organization or "official" source that can police the 
                   community. Anyone claiming to speak officially on behalf of czodiac
                   is not authorized to do so and should be disregarded. Also, as outlined
                   in more details in the Terms of Use, this community is for experimentation 
                   and fun, not profit. That means dapps frequently get hacked, have economic design flaws,
                   or are even expensive jokes. So don't come here to invest, come here to play, experiment, and have fun.</p>
